Exercise 6-1. 

If you have a question about whether something is legal, and what happens if it is not, 

a good way to find out is to ask the compiler. Answer the following questions by try‐ 

ing them out. 

  

1. What happens if you invoke a value method and don’t do anything with the 

result; that is, if you don’t assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expres‐ 

sion? 

CODE 

public class Tryout { 

    public static double tryout(double x) { 

        return; 

  

    } 

  

    public static void main(String[] args) { 

        System.out.println( tryout(3)); 

    } 

} 

WHAT HAPPENS, DISPLAY: 

java: incompatible types: missing return value 


2. What happens if you use a void method as part of an expression? For example, 

try System.out.println("boo!") + 7;

public class Tryout { 

    public static double tryout(double x) { 

        x = System.out.println ("boo!") + 7; 

        return -x; 

  

    } 

  

    public static void main(String[] args) { 

        System.out.println( tryout(3)); 

    } 

} 

ANSWER: 

java: 'void' type not allowed here
