Exercise 7-1. 

Consider the following methods: 

public static void main(String[] args) { 

loop(10); 

} 

public static void loop(int n) { 

int i = n; 

while (i > 1) { 

System.out.println(i); 

if (i % 2 == 0) { 

i = i / 2; 

} else { 

i = i + 1; 

} 

} 

} 

1. Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration. 
 n    i
10   10  
10   5 
10   6 
10   3 
10   4 
10   2 

2. What is the output of this program? 

The output of the program is 

10 
5 
6 
3 
4 
2 

3. Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n? 

Yes, this loop terminates for all positive values of n as soon as i=1.
