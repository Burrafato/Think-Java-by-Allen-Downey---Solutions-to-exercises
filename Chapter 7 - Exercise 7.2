Exercise 7-2. 

Using this formula: x1= (x0+ a/x0)/2 

Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double and returns an approximation 

of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You should not use 

Math.sqrt. 

As your initial guess, you should use a/2. Your method should iterate until it gets two 

consecutive estimates that differ by less than 0.0001. You can use Math.abs to calcu‐ 

late the absolute value of the difference.  

package th.domi.learn; 
import java.util.Scanner; 
 
 
public class Main { 
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); 
System.out.println("Type a number: "); 
double number = input.nextDouble(); 
// prompt the user to insert a number to find its squareroot 
System.out.println("The square root of " + number + " is: " + squareRoot(number)); 
} 
 
public static double squareRoot(double a) { 
double guess = a/2; 
double x1 = (guess + a/guess)/2; 
double difference = Math.abs(guess - x1); 
 
while(difference > 0.0001){ 
System.out.println(guess); // i want all values to be printed until the correct answer is reached 
x1 = (guess + a/guess)/2; 
difference = Math.abs(x1 - guess); 
guess = x1; // update x 
} 
return x1; 
} 
} 
 
 
OTHER SOLUTION 

package th.domi.learn; 
import java.util.Random; 
import java.util.Scanner; 
 
 
public class Main { 
 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
Random random = new Random(); 
int number = random.nextInt(1000) + 1; 
// the bot generates a random number between 1 and 100 
System.out.println("What is the square root of " + number + " ?"); 
// prompt the user to guess the square root of the number generated 
System.out.println("The square root of " + number + " is: " + squareRoot(number)); 
} 
 
 
public static double squareRoot(double a) { 
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); 
double guess = input.nextDouble(); 
double x1 = (guess + a/guess)/2; 
double difference = Math.abs(guess - x1); 
 
while(difference > 0.0001){ 
System.out.println(guess); // i want all values to be printed until the correct answer is reached 
x1 = (guess + a/guess)/2; 
difference = Math.abs(x1 - guess); 
guess = x1; // update x 
} 
return x1; 
}
